			<p>Hi!  My name is Steven and I'm part of the UNC Boot Camp class!  I'm a software developer with a background mainly in C++ applications for the defense and retail industries.  I graduated from Clemson University in 2004 with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering.</p>

			<p>I've lived in the Triangle area for over six years.  Outside of work, I manage and play on several indoor soccer teams, and I'm on the local leadership team for a national charity that raises money for the Children's Miracle Network through playing video and board games.  </p>
